## Overview
### Zomato: Discover Your Culinary Journey
Zomato is an online food delivery platform, but its true objective lies in making users discover their favoraite cuisine, restaurants, dish, etc.

"Indulge your taste buds with Zomato, your ultimate guide to a world of gastronomic delights. Whether you're a foodie on the hunt for new culinary experiences or simply seeking a satisfying meal, Zomato is your trusted companion."
